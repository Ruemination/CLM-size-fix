**Install guide:**
* Click on the CLM-size-fix.zip and download by clicking the button titled RAW in the top right
* Navigate to the addons folder of your wow installation. If you are unsure where this is, you can click the gear icon next to Play in battlenet and then hit "Show in Explorer" ...World of Warcraft\classic\Interface\addons
* Extract the contents of the .zip into said folder (that's to say, copy over the folders called ClassicLootManager, ClassicLootManager_Alerts, ClassicLootManager_Integrations, and ClassicLootManager_Tracker separately straight into the /addons/ folder)
* Enable addon in game
